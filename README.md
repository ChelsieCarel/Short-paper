 This article presents a multimodal approach to hybrid recommendation systems by combining data from different 
forms in the field of tourism in Cameroon. With the explosion of the tourism industry and the spread of social media on 
online platforms, users find themselves overwhelmed by a multitude of information in various formats (photos, texts, 
videos, etc.). The task of the latter is complicated in such a situation because it is necessary to make decisions and obtain 
tailor-made recommendations regarding travel-related services. In the field of e-commerce, recommendation systems (RS) 
are widely used to improve conversion rates by adjusting product offerings based on preferences and customer interests 
can also play a fundamental role in the field of tourism. If traditional RS relies exclusively on numerical evaluations to 
formulate recommendations, these evaluations cannot always be sufficient to offer tailor-made and precise suggestions.
Our approach combines both collaborative filtering (Col-F or User to user) filtering based on content (Con-B or Item to item) 
as well as the geographical area. The system we offer combines the advantages of other systems by using tools like CNN 
(VGG16 and ResnetT50) to analyze images of tourist sites and classify them according to tourist destinations, other deals 
with the analysis of user reviews with textual data using sentiment analysis techniques such as LSTM, to provide users with 
more accurate recommendations and finally geography is used for new users to solve the cold start problem. By integrating 
various recommendation methods, our system hybridiz
